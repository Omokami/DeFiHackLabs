In [01_Tools](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs/tree/main/academy/onchain_debug/01_tools/en), we learned how to use various tools to analyze transactions in smart contracts.

In  [02_Warm](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/academy/onchain_debug/02_warmup/en/readme.md), we analyzed a transaction on a decentralized exchange using Foundry.

For this publication, we will analyze a hacker incident utilizing an oracle exploit. We’ll take you step-by-step through key function calls and then we’ll reproduce the attack together using the Foundry framework.


## Why is Reproducing Attacks Helpful?

At DeFiHackLabs we intend to promote Web3 security. We hope that when attacks happen, more people can analyze and contribute to overall security.

1. As unfortunate victims we improve our incident response and effectiveness.
2. As a whitehat we improve our ability in writing PoCs and snatch bug bounties. 
3. Aid the blue team in adjusting machine learning models. Ie., [Forta Network](https://forta.org/blog/how-fortas-predictive-ml-models-detect-attacks-before-exploitation/).
4. You’ll learn much more from reproducing the attack compared to reading post-mortems.
5. Improve your overall Solidity ”Kung Fu“.

### Some Need-to-knows Before Reproducing Transactions

1. Understanding of common attack modes. Which we have curated in [DeFiVulnLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiVulnLabs).
2. Understanding of basic DeFi mechanisms including how smart contracts interact with each other.

### DeFi Oracle Introduction

Currently, smart contract values such as pricing and configuration cannot update themselves. To execute its contract logic, external data is sometimes required during execution. This is typically done with the following methods.

1. Through externally owned accounts. We can calculate the price based on the reserves of these accounts.
2. Use an oracle, which is maintained by someone or even yourself. With external data updated periodically. ie., price, interest rate, anything. 

* For example, in Uniswap V2, they provide the current price of the asset, which is used to determine the relative value of the asset being traded and thus execute the trade.

  * Following the figure, ETH price is the external data. The smart contract obtains it from Uniswap V2.

    We know the formula  `x * y = k` in a typical AMM. `x` ( ETH price in this case) =  `k / y`.

    So we take a look at the Uniswap V2 WETH/USDC trading pair contract. At this address `0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc`.

![UniV2PairInfo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231355-0d1fb43e-280e-4328-b71e-9797be5ce7ec.png)

* At the time of publication we see the following reserve values:

  * WETH: `33,906.6145928`  USDC: `42,346,768.252804` 

  * Formula: Applying the `x * y = k` formula will yield the price for each ETH:

     `42,346,768.252804 / 33,906.6145928 = 1248.9235`
     
   (Market prices may differ from the calculated price by a few cents. In most cases, this refers to a trading fee or a new transaction that affects the pool. This variance can be skimmed with `skim()`[^1].)

  * Solidity Pseudocode: For the lending contract to fetch the current ETH price, the pseudocode can be as the following:

```solidity=
uint256 UniV2_ETH_Reserve = WETH.balanceOf(0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc);
uint256 UniV2_USDC_Reserve = USDC.balanceOf(0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc);
uint256 ETH_Price = UniV2_USDC_Reserve / UniV2_ETH_Reserve;
```
   > #### Please note this method of obtaining price is easily manipulated. Please do not use it in the production code.

[^1]: Skim() :
Uniswap V2 is a decentralized exchange(DEX) that uses a liquidity pool to trade assets. It has a `skim()`function as a safety measure to protect against potential issues from customized token implementations that may change the balance of the pair contract. However, `skim()`can also be used in conjunction with price manipulation.
Please see the figure for a full explanation of Skim().

  * Oracle manipulation: [WTFSolidity](https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Solidity/blob/main/S15_OracleManipulation/readme.md).

### Oracle Price Manipulation Attack Modes

Most common attack modes:

1. Alter the oracle address
    * Root cause: lack of verification mechanism
    * For example: [Rikkei Finance](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs#20220415-rikkei-finance---access-control--price-oracle-manipulation)
2. Through flash loans, an attacker can drain liquidity, resulting in wrong pricing information in an oracle.
    * This is most often seen in attackers calling these functions. GetPrice、Swap、StackingReward, Transfer(with burn fee), etc.
    * Root cause: Protocols using unsafe/compromised oracles, or the oracle did not implement time-weighted average price features.
    * Example: [One Ring Finance](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs#20220321-onering-finance---flashloan--price-oracle-manipulation)

    >  Protip-case 2: During code review ensure the function`balanceOf()`is well guarded.

## Step-by-step PoC - An Example from EGD Finance

### Step 1: Information gathering

* Upon discovery of an attack. Twitter will often be the front line of the aftermath. Top DeFi analysts will continuously publish their new findings there.

> Protip: Join the [DeFiHackLabs Discord](https://discord.gg/Fjyngakf3h) security-alert channel to receive curated updates from top DeFi analysts!

* Upon an attack incident, it is important to gather and organize the newest information. Here is a template!
  1. Transaction ID
  2. Attacker Address(EOA)
  3. Attack Contract Address
  4. Vulnerable Address
  5. Total Loss
  6. Reference Links
  7. Post-mortem Links
  8. Vulnerable snippet
  9. Audit History

> Protip: Use the [Exploit-Template.sol](/script/Exploit-template.sol) template from DeFiHackLabs.
---
### Step 2: Transaction Debugging

Based on experience, 12 hours after the attack, 90% of the attack autopsy will have been completed. It’s usually not too difficult to analyze the attack at this point.

* We will use a real case of [EGD Finance Exploit attack](https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1556483435388350464) as an example, to help you understand :
  1. the risk in oracle manipulation.
  2. how to profit from oracle manipulation.
  3. flash loans transaction.
  4. how attackers reproduce by only 1 transaction to accomplish the attack.

* Let's use [Phalcon](https://phalcon.blocksec.com/tx/bsc/0x50da0b1b6e34bce59769157df769eb45fa11efc7d0e292900d6b0a86ae66a2b3) from Blocksec to analyze the EGD Finance incident.
<img width="1644" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-11 at 4 59 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107821372/211762771-d2c54800-4595-4630-9392-30431094bfca.png">

* In Ethereum EVM, you will see 3 call types to trigger remote functions:
  1. Call: Typical cross-contract function call, will often change the receiver’s storage.
  2. StaticCall: Will not change the receiver’s storage, used for fetching state and variables.
  3. DelegateCall: `msg.sender`  will remain the same, typically used in proxying calls. Please see [WTF Solidity](https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Solidity/tree/main/23_Delegatecall) for more details.

> Please note, internal function calls[^2] are not visible in Ethereum EVM.
[^2]: Internal function calls are invisible to the blockchain since they don't create any new transactions or blocks. In this way, they cannot be read by other smart contracts or show up in the blockchain transaction history.
* Further Information - Attackers Flash loan attack mode
  1. Check if the attack will be profitable. First, ensure loans can be obtained, then ensure the target has enough balance.
     - This means you will see some 'static calls' in the beginning.
  2. Use DEX or Lending Protocols to obtain a flash loan, look for the following key function calls
     - UniswapV2, Pancakeswap: `.swap()`
     - Balancer: `flashLoan()`
     - DODO: `.flashloan()`
     - AAVE: `.flashLoan()`
  3. Callbacks from flash loan protocol to attacker’s contract, look for the following key function calls
        - UniswapV2: `.uniswapV2Call()`
        - Pancakeswap: `.Pancakeswap()`
        - Balancer: `.receiveFlashLoan()`
        - DODO: `.DXXFlashLoanCall()`
        - AAVE: `.executeOperation()`
   4. Execute the attack to profit from contract weakness.
   5. Return the flash loan

### Practice: 

Identify various stages of the EGD Finance Exploit attack on [Phalcon](https://phalcon.blocksec.com/tx/bsc/0x50da0b1b6e34bce59769157df769eb45fa11efc7d0e292900d6b0a86ae66a2b3). More specifically ‘flashloan‘, ’callback‘, ’weakness‘, and ’profit’.

>Protip: If you are unable to understand the logic of individual function calls. Try tracing through the entire call stack sequentially, take notes, and pay special attention to the money trail. You’ll have a much better understanding after doing this a few times.

        require(suc, "Flashloan[1] payback failed");
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Analyzing the exploit

We see here the attacker called `Pancakeswap.swap()` function to take advantage of the exploit, looks like there is a second flash loan call in the call stack.
![Flashloan2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231489-4977bc1d-4ed0-45f8-b014-8de92942fe4f.png)

* Pancakeswap uses the `.pancakeCall()` interface to perform a callback on the attacker’s contract. You might be wondering how the attacker is executing different codes during each of the two callbacks.

The key is in the first flash loan, the attacker used `0x0000` in callback data.
![FlashloanCallbackData1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231501-7b8e508a-a6fe-4f28-9308-5406d0dec32f.png)

However, during the second flash loan, the attacker used `0x00` in callback data.
![FlashloanCallbackData2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231506-e76cc110-3969-486d-b917-7ddec3d46ee5.png)


Through this method, an attacking contract can determine what code to execute based on the `_data` parameter. Which could be either 0x0000 or 0x00.

* Let's continue with analyzing the second callback logic during the second flash loan.

During the second callback, the attacker only called `claimAllReward()` from EGD Finance:

![CallClaimReward](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231522-a54ef929-63e3-4b9c-8f0c-e609c2055b2c.png)

Further expanding the `claimAllReward()` call stack. You’ll find EGD Finance performed a read on `0xa361-Cake-LP` for the balance of EGD Token and USDT, then transferred a large amount of EGD Token to the attacker’s contract.

![ClaimRewardDetail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231532-d9b0e7ce-ee65-48fb-a2eb-6fccbb799234.png)

<details><summary>What is the '0xa361-Cake-LP' contract?</summary>

Using Etherscan, we can see what trading pair `0xa361-Cake-LP` corresponds to.

* Option 1(faster)： View the first two largest reserve tokens of the contract in [Etherscan](https://bscscan.com/address/0xa361433e409adac1f87cdf133127585f8a93c67d) 

![Etherscan-Top2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231654-613672c0-400d-4e53-891c-4c309d8ce84c.png)
* Option 2(accurate)：[Read Contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xa361433e409adac1f87cdf133127585f8a93c67d#readContract) Check the address of token0 and token1.

<img width="404" alt="Etherscan-ReadContract" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231545-43777f4e-6433-4dba-b2dc-ab54cd7aaeed.png">

This indicates that `0xa361-Cake-LP` is the EGD/USDT trading pair contract。

</details>
<br>

* Let's analyze the `claimAllReward()`  function to see where the exploit lies.
<img width="1518" alt="ClaimRewardCode" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231553-770e01d9-d809-43e1-99df-8674b0b30c8c.png">

We see that the amount of Staking Reward is based on the reward`quota` factor (Meaning the amount of staking, and duration of staking) multiplied by `getEGDPrice()` the current EGD token price.

**In return this means, the EGD Staking Reward is based on the price of the EGD Token. Less reward is yielded on a high EGD Token price and vice versa.**

* Now let's check how the `getEGDPrice()` function gets the current price of EGD Token:

<img width="529" alt="getEGDPrice" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231565-596b32d8-cbb9-4f59-a53e-77d837d2766c.png">

We see the all-familiar equation `x * y = k` like the one we introduced earlier in the DeFi oracle introduction section, to obtain the current price. The address of the trading `pair`  is `0xa361-Cake-LP` which matches the two STATICCALLs from the transaction view.

![getEGDPrice_Static](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26408530/211231574-bb7a652d-3538-4ca1-859d-a30962014d44.png)

So how is the attacker taking advantage of this unsafe method of getting current prices?

The underlying mechanism is such that, from the second flash loan the attacker borrowed a large amount of USDT, therefore influencing the pool price based on the `x * y = k` formula. Before returning the loan, the `getEGDPrice()`  will be incorrect.

Reference diagram:
![CleanShot 2023-01-12 at 17 01 46@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107821372/212027306-3a7f9a8c-4995-472c-a8c7-39e5911b531d.png)
**Conclusion:  The attacker used a flash loan to alter the liquidity of the EGD/USDT trading pair, resulting in `ClaimReward()` getting an incorrect price, allowing the attacker to obtain an obscene amount of EGD tokens.**

Finally, the attacker exchanged EGD Token using Pancakeswap for USDT, thus profiting from the attack.

### Step 5: Reproduce
Now that we’ve fully understood the attack, let's reproduce it:
