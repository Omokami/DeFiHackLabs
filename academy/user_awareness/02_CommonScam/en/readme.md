There‘s plenty of buzz around Web 3.0 and innovations in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but few understand the hidden risks with this technology.

As it is still emerging, widespread misuse raises concerns about fraud, money laundering, and hacking.

In this article, the XREX information security team will introduce information security in the Web3 world. We will learn simple to advanced security concepts, analyze hacking methods, and give you practical advice on protecting your personal information and digital assets.

### What is Web 3.0 and why is it important?

Looking back at Web 3.0 predecessors, Web 1.0 and 2.0, will allow us to know why it is an important milestone.

* Web 1.0 & Web2.0

Since the 1990s, the internet has affected all aspects of our lives. From simple everyday tasks to politics, to economy, education and communication, the list is long.

Over the past three decades, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have made the internet accessible to billions of people. Nonetheless, we also face significant challenges from adopting them.

Tech giants realized that personal information is a precious asset. They monopolized the internet industry and took control of user-generated data, information, and content. 

People sacrificed security for the convenience of these services, whether or not they knew it. Once uploaded, personal information no longer belongs to the user, but is centrally managed and utilized by a specific vendor.

For example, Facebook's voice commenting system transcribes user voice files into text files for analysis by their AI systems. Google's search algorithms collect user preferences and re-sale them to interested parties. Spotify exploits music creators and takes 30% of their profit. When online game operators stop their services, virtual items instantly become worthless.

Moreover, what we read from the internet may contain intentionally incomplete data and guided advertisements to influence our cognition and decision-making.

Although Web1.0 and Web2.0 introduced these problems, they also contributed to the birth of Web 3.0, or Web3

* Web3

Web3 technology is considered the best solution for Web 1.0 and 2.0.

Web3 utilizes blockchain technologies with a decentralized structure, due to its immutability, openness, transparency, and open-source nature. It incentivises users to take ownership and control their own data instead of relying on big tech companies.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper which introduced the concept of "decentralization." This was a revolutionary concept. We immediately started to dream and began work on various defi projects, from Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFT, Defi, and now the famous "Move-to-earn" app, STEPN.

Thanks to the implementation of different projects, users regained autonomy and freedom. Many defi projects implemented DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) using block chain, so that users can share values and benefits through DAOs.

Yet as technology evolves, so do abuses. A common stereotype on cryptocurrencies is that it is usually associated with money laundering and fraud.

Blockchain is decentralized, which means users are responsible for protecting assets and identities. No institution or entity can alter or restore transactions on the blockchain. As a result,  many criminal groups can execute scams and use defi vulnerabilities anonymously.

### Damages/losses in Web3 security incidents

According to [data](https://hacked.slowmist.io/statistics/?c=all&d=all) from SlowMist, a well-known blockchain security company, from 2012 to Jan 2023, there were at least 909 hacking incidents in the entire blockchain ecosystem, with losses exceeding $28.9 billion.

According to [The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze), since 2021 more than 46,000 people have reported losing over **$1 billion** in crypto scams.

It is worth noting that this does not count global data and only records the data of reported cases, which means that many victims are still not on record. It is difficult for us to know the number of victims and the number of losses.

### What do hackers want?

<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107821372/211486583-6fcca218-06dc-4e1e-b3d2-1db5e4389a23.png" alt="Cover" width="80%"/>
</div>

Based on the figure above, hackers can be classified into four categories based on their purpose:

* Crypto assets
* Wallet layer
* Transfer right
* Web 2.0 Credentials

To obtain illicit profits, hackers use various methods to get the following information:

* Use strong cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or high-priced NFTs, to obtain hard currency. The "give $1, and I will return $10" scheme is a classic investment gift scam.
* Find out private keys, tokens, or passwords of cryptocurrency wallets.
* Transfer the user's virtual assets to another wallet after obtaining the user's consent to transfer assets on a smart contract.
* Obtain the user's account number and password in  cryptocurrency exchanges from Web 2.0.

We know what hackers want; so what can we do to protect our data and assets?

“You should always keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”

* Understanding common threats and attack methods can prevent one from being deceived and becoming a victim.
* Be alert at all times and keep up on modern information security awareness and habits.
* Lastly, before you confirm anything, question yourself if you have any doubt or uncertainty.

To help identify attacks and scams, XREX compiled nine Web3 attack methods. We will showcase three of them below.

### Web3 attack methods 

## 1. Credential Phishing

Credential phishing starts with fake websites, such as phony exchange logins or airdrop unlock pages. Without being aware of these fake websites, a user may enter their real account information and passwords, resulting in stolen credentials.

Using tools such as Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) and Goclone, hackers can copy the front-end design of a simple website directly to a local server and then register a domain name similar to the official website. Therefore, we should pay utmost attention to the authenticity of the URL.

In addition, fake communication messages can be a source of attack. These include email, social media, mobile text messages, phony customer service on Telegram, etc.

<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52526645/211229629-cb4ddbeb-9c4d-4b5d-b8d7-247497cf2de0.png" alt="Cover" width="80%"/>

</div>
<p align="center">Figure 1.3 / Attacker sends phishing link via SMS, redirecting the victim to the mobile phishing site.</p>

Credential phishing attacks are a low-cost and high-paying method for hackers because it costs only a few dollars to send 100,000 phishing messages. However, if just one or two people fall into these traps, the hack may be profitable, sometimes they even make extremely high illegal profits.

### How to prevent Credential Phishing? XREX recommends:


* Add frequently used websites to your Favorites or Bookmarks Bar to avoid phishing sites.
* Protect your passwords with a password manager like Lastpass, NordPass, or Keeper Security.
* Install anti**-**phishing plugins like [Netcraft Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netcraft-extension/bmejphbfclcpmpohkggcjeibfilpamia?hl=en), [PeckShieldAlert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/peckshieldalert/dakkielolpafjbgnjnakddabmbbkcioe), [Scam Sniffer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scam-sniffer/mnkbccinkbalkmmnmbcicdobcmgggmfc), [Wallet Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallet-guard/pdgbckgdncnhihllonhnjbdoighgpimk), or [MetaShield](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metashield/dibeogjcfnjbocgdjnehncoagplahokb?hl=zh-TW&authuser=4) in your browser to automatically detect phishing sites.
* Never use the same password for more than one account to prevent multiple accounts from being stolen by using one password.
* Set complex passwords. We recommend passwords have a minimum of 10 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, numbers, and one special symbol.
* If you find a suspicious website, please report it immediately. This is one way to protect the security of the decentralized ecosystem.

## 2. Ad-hijacking

Ad-hijacking (also known as brand poaching, direct linking, URL jacking) is similar to credential phishing, except that ad-hijackers uses a fake domain, copy the text of target brands ads, then uses a higher cost-per-click (CPC). 

Sometimes search-engine-optimization (SEO) ranks their site higher than official ones in search engine results. When a user searches by using a keyword, the first result may be a fake website, and thus unsuspecting users fall into a trap.

In the picture below, we queried STEPN, the recently popular "Move-to-earn" app, as an example. Search STEPN on Google, and the top four results are all fake sites.

<div align=center>

</div>
<p align="center">Figure 2.1 / Searching for STEPN on Google reveals Google ads full of phishing scams.</p>

### How to prevent ad-hijacking? XREX recommends:
* Pay extra attention to suspicious domains when searching for keyword clicks.
* Add frequently used websites to Your Favorites or Bookmarks Bar to avoid phishing sites.
* Install anti**-**phishing plugins like [Netcraft Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netcraft-extension/bmejphbfclcpmpohkggcjeibfilpamia?hl=en), [PeckShieldAlert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/peckshieldalert/dakkielolpafjbgnjnakddabmbbkcioe), [Scam Sniffer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scam-sniffer/mnkbccinkbalkmmnmbcicdobcmgggmfc), [Wallet Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallet-guard/pdgbckgdncnhihllonhnjbdoighgpimk), or [MetaShield](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metashield/dibeogjcfnjbocgdjnehncoagplahokb?hl=zh-TW&authuser=4) in your browser to automatically detect phishing sites.
* If you find a suspicious website, please report it immediately.

## 3. Fake Customer Service

Hackers pretend to be official employees of defi projects on social media. They trick users into filling out forms such as airdrop registration and service satisfaction surveys.

If a user takes the bait, the hacker will ask further questions to get a victim's wallet address and personal information, or transfer virtual currency to the hacker's wallet address.

For example:

"The threshold for real-name verification does not match, and the wallet address needs to be verified."

"Need to transfer cryptocurrency to a specified wallet address to unlock the password."

### How to prevent Fake Customer Service? XREX recommends:
* Don't trust unsolicited private messages from Telegram or other social platforms. Official projects will never suddenly send personal messages to users and ask for account information.
* If you have concerns on divulging sensitive information, such as deposit and withdrawal, real-name authentication, or account security, please contact the official website channel for assistance.
* Strengthen the privacy settings on Telegram. Set "Only my contacts can add me." Please refer to the following steps to complete the settings:

<div align=center>

</div>

###4. Fake social media giveaway

Social media is a gold mine for scammers, said Federal Trade Commission (FTC) officials.

Many people rely on social media - it's part of their lives. However,[ FTC reports](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/01/social-media-gold-mine-scammers-2021) indicate scammers are increasingly using social media to con people. 

Hacker hotspots include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other popular social media platforms. To lure readers into taking their bait, hackers create bogus official accounts or use well-known accounts to post messages claiming to give away cryptocurrency, such as “give me $1, and I will return you $10”

* Case Sharing - Indian PM Modi's Twitter account was hacked with bitcoin tweets.

* It was [reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indian-pm-narendra-modis-hacked-035907977.html) that Narendra Modi's personal Twitter account, which has more than 73 million followers, was hacked last year.

* Using the account @narendramodi, a hacker tweeted, "India has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and distributed bitcoins to its citizens." A scam link was included with the tweet to lure readers.

Modi’s office quickly deleted the tweet and declared the safe recovery of the Twitter account, but information security concerns still remain.

Through social media, scammers trick people into clicking fraudulent links or sending cryptocurrency to the scammer's address. As a victim, this is just the beginning.  

Scammers may ask victims to pay an upfront fee – after the victim has already been scammed. This could be money, stock, or warrants for the deal to go through. Of course, it never will.

</div>
<p align="center">Figure 4.3 / Hackers use compromised official accounts to deceive others. </p>

### How to avoid social media giveaway scams? XREX recommends:

* Verify information validity from multiple sources and ignore any free advertising.
* Consider twice before sending coins from a promise to get more. If it’s too good to be true, it is usually too good to be true.
* Beware pop-ups from wallet apps related to transfers or authorizations.
* Keep in mind, transactions in decentralized finance cannot be reversed.
                  
## 5. Ponzi schemes

In Ponzi schemes, funds are collected from new investors and used to pay existing investors. It is common for Ponzi scheme organizers to promise **high returns with small or no risk**. However, Ponzi schemes are by definition not sustainable.

The name Ponzi scheme originated from Charles Ponzi, who duped investors with postage stamp speculation schemes in the 1920s.

* How to identify a Ponzi scheme?
                  
   An ambiguous economic model is a common characteristic of a Ponzi scheme. Thus, the project can promise investors an unreasonable high rate of return even though it is challenging to operate. An example is shown in the screenshots below:
                  
<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52526645/211230305-0e6c25ac-0535-4757-83e9-8257d1797a7e.png" alt="Cover" width="80%"/>

</div>
<p align="center">Figure 5.2 / Another platform claims to offer arbitrage opportunities, predictive indicators, market analysis, and insider information to entice users into investing.</p>

### How to a avoid Ponzi scheme? XREX recommends:
* Be sure to choose an exchange that is licensed, compliant with the law, and has a transparent team. XREX has obtained relevant regulatory licenses and permits such as anti-money laundering compliance and others in the following countries: United States, Canada, Lithuania, Estonia, and Taiwan. XREX is currently applying for licenses in Singapore and Dubai.
* Do verify the registration and reputation of any adviser and/or trading platform with the appropriate sources or governing bodies before investing with them.
* Avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) and check if the rate of return makes any sense.

## 6. Rug pulls
Rug pulls are crypto scams where a team pumps the value of its token before disappearing with investors' funds_. _A rug pull occurs when fraudsters create a new crypto token, pump up its price, then abandon it as soon as it is about to collapse.

* Case sharing - Squid Game (SQUID)

Squid Game (SQUID), the cryptocurrency token inspired by the Netflix hit, rose to hundreds of thousands In just one week. Yet it collapsed immediately. Investors lost everything and had nowhere to ask for compensation.

Rug pulls can also occur in un-audited smart contracts through pre-programmed contract backdoors, allowing the fraudsters to control the supply of tokens after fundraising.
<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52526645/211230424-27cf4410-5afb-4fd2-96c4-4e32626721f5.png" alt="Cover" width="60%"/>
</div>
<p align="center">Figure 6.1 / Squid Coin, with no official links to Netflix or the "Squid Game" team, the token price surged from $0.01 to $2861 within seven days and then collapsed to $0.0008 instantly. </p>

### How to prevent rug pulls? XREX recommends:
* When choosing a project, you can first understand the project team's background by searching on LinkedIn. Also search for the research project's white paper, and other relevant information. Typically, the white paper must contain long-term goals, problems solved, technical descriptions, and the team's authenticity.
* To raise funds, most projects will use a centralized or decentralized exchange. 
* By analyzing on-chain data, one can observe the transaction volume of tokens, liquidity, and whether the project tokens are certified by top decentralized exchanges.
* Verify that multiple information security companies have reviewed the smart contract and that the audit report is open-sourced.
* See if there are hype social bots on social media regarding the project. Fake hype is typically done with social bots and paid followers, which attempts to engage consumers to be excited and believe in a product that is in high demand and low supply.

## 7. Seed phrase phishing

A seed phrase is a master key that unlocks access to all your crypto assets, typically in the mnemonic form. A mnemonic is usually a 12 to 24 word phrase that cryptography represents your private key, making it slightly easier to remember and recover. A person with access to the mnemonic is equivalent to having access to the encrypted assets,

similar to your bank account username and password. Some phishing scams trick users into divulging their seed phrase, resulting in lost funds stored in crypto wallets.
<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52526645/211230520-fd21d858-41f0-44f4-ab4e-7035891d86cd.png" alt="Cover" width="80%"/>
</div>
<p align="center"> 
Figure 7.1 / A fake OpeaSea NFT marketplace with a price significantly lower than the market price, requiring users to enter a mnemonic during transactions.  </p>

### How to prevent seed phrase phishing? XREX recommends:
* Never leak the mnemonic phrase. Other than restoring the wallet access, the mnemonic phrase has no other purpose except staying in a safe place.
* Please store the mnemonic properly. Apps that require you to enter the mnemonic are _always_ scams.
* Upon encountering suspicious websites, report it immediately! Keep the DeFi ecosystem safe.

## 8. Malicious wallets and plugins

Malicious wallets or wallet plug-ins will imitate the UI of genuine wallets, tricking users into thinking it is a project's official wallet. However, a backdoor has already been set up in the backend, and is able to steal the wallet mnemonic and assets.

<div align=center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52526645/211230556-fcc7e217-4c6d-43c4-9900-b52261f145f2.png" alt="Cover" width="80%"/>

</div>

<p align="center"> Figure 8.2 / A fake AppStore requires users to download a file, once installed, you can download MetaMask with a backdoor from an untrusted source.  </p>

### How to avoid fraudulent wallets and plugins? XREX recommends:
* Never use crypto assets on jailbroken or rooted devices.
* Be sure to download mobile apps from official sources such as the Apple AppStore or Google Play Store.
* This one is for Apple iOS only: Do not install or trust profiles from unknown sources, as this may allow you to inadvertently install malicious programs.


## 9. Approval scam

Unlike a traditional fraud, an approval scammer attempts to gain your right of transfer to certain addresses. This is a built-in mechanism in the ERC20 token standard. ERC20 Approve function allows smart contracts to have the right to transfer user crypto assets.

For example, if a user grants approval permissions to an arbitrage contract, it could execute multiple trades to automatically carry out arbitrage on the decentralized exchange. 

However, the ERC20 Approve function has inevitably become a tool for hackers. Through phishing, hackers trick users into granting approval permission to hackers, then transfer the victim's assets to their wallets through the transferFrom function of the ERC20 Token contract.

### The most well-known recent cases:
* [The theft of NFT from Jay Chou](https://medium.com/sentinel-protocol/%E5%93%A5%E8%A2%AB%E5%81%B7%E4%BA%86-brother-got-robbed-jay-chous-ape-not-the-only-one-ca0a90d4dab4), a famous Taiwanese singer.
* Fraudsters used the NFT platform [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/our-efforts-to-curb-fraud-and-plagiarism-and-whats-next/) to launch a new type of fraud by first randomly airdropping users then raising NFT prices on the OpenSea to lure victims into a phishing website.

### How to avoid approval scams? XREX recommends:
* If you accidentally authorized an unknown address, revoke the authorization immediately to avoid losses.
* Confirm the transaction content before executing the transaction in order to avoid performing unexpected operations.
* Report suspicious websites.
* Regularly check the authorization status of wallet addresses and revoke permissions for unknown addresses. The following are three common tools:
    -[Ethereum Token Approval](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)
    -[Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)
    -[Approved.zone](https://approved.zone/)

## Let's sum it up

This blog is an overview of the common Web3 crypto hacks – from phishing to rug pull – to help us better understand Web3 and avoid becoming victims.

The XREX  information security team reminds you to keep an eye out on information security and to stay vigilant. As Web3 applications develop rapidly, hackers and criminals are also improving their tactics.
