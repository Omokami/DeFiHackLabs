## Background

The idea of Bitcoin was first presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in November 2008, and it was officially launched in January 2009. As the global digital economy gained momentum, the notion of encrypted assets, such as NFTs, began to gain traction. Colored Coin, a token similar to NFTs, was developed in 2012 using small denominations of Bitcoin, with the minimum unit being one satoshi. With the continued advancement of technology, NFTs gained immense popularity in 2021 and gradually became one of the most popular investment trends in the market.

NFTs are currently fetching exorbitant prices, with examples such as “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by Beeple selling for $69,346,250 on Christie’s official website and a virtual plot of land on the Sandbox virtual gaming platform selling for $4.3 million. As the craze persists, a wave of costly projects is keeping people on edge. However, this steep valuation has also attracted the notice of criminals, resulting in a rise in phishing and theft aimed at NFTs.

## The Current State of NFTs

The opening narration of the Netflix documentary “Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King” recounts the tale of the CEO of QuadrigaCX, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, who passed away under puzzling circumstances, leaving behind $250 million in customer funds. Many of the concerned investors reject the official explanation, suspecting that the CEO’s alleged demise may have been part of a “Phoenix Scam,” in which he faked his death and ran away with their money.

The QuadrigaCX saga, however, is just one example of the many issues faced by the Web3 community. Theft is almost a routine occurrence in the NFT world that we are discussing today, and there are numerous high-profile cases to illustrate this fact:

* On February 21, 2021, a phishing attack of the personal_sign type was perpetrated against an OpenSea user. As a result, 32 users signed a harmful transaction from the attacker, leading to the loss of various NFTs, including BAYC, Azuki, and close to a hundred others, with a value of $4.2 million at the time.

* On April 29, 2022, a Bored Ape NFT belonging to Jay Chou was stolen, with a value of 3.2 million RMB.

* On May 25, 2022, A Twitter user with the handle @0xLosingMoney reported that a user named @Dvincent_ had stolen 29 Moonbird NFTs, valued at over $700,000, by means of a phishing website named p2peers[.]io.

* On June 28, 2022, Nickydooodles.eth, the creator of the Web3 initiative Metabergs, disclosed that his wallet had been hacked through a phishing attempt. The attacker made off with 17 ETH, which was approximately worth $21,077 at the time, as well as all of his NFT collections, including Goblintown NFT, Doodles NFT, Sandbox Land, and many others.

* On November 1, 2022, the Discord channel of the KUMALEON initiative was breached, and nearly 111 NFTs belonging to the community were taken, which included BAYC #5313, ENS, ALIENFRENS, Art Blocks, and various other assets.

* On December 31, 2021, Kramer, a user of Twitter, claimed that he fell victim to a phishing attack. He clicked on a link that seemed to belong to a legitimate NFT DApp, but in reality, it was a scam. The result was the loss of 16 of his NFTs, consisting of 8 Bored Apes, 7 Mutant Apes, and 1 Clonex, with a total worth of $1.9 million.

* On January 15, 2023, the famous blogger @NFT_GOD suffered a severe loss when all of his accounts, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs were stolen. The theft occurred after he clicked on a phishing ad link on Google. The compromised accounts included Substack, Twitter, and various other platforms.

* On January 26, 2023, Kevin Rose, the creator of the renowned NFT initiative Moonbirds, suffered a hacking incident that led to the loss of over 40 NFTs, which had a value of over $2 million.

* On January 28, 2023, the official Twitter account of the famed NFT venture Azuki was compromised. As a result, its followers were directed to phishing links, which led to the theft of over 122 NFTs, valued at over $780,000.

* On February 8, 2023, a victim lost more than $1.2 million in USDC to a long-running NFT phishing scam that was linked to a fraudulent address.

 In response to the frequent and significant consequences of NFT theft, SlowMist Technology has released two specialized tracking analyses to address NFT phishing groups.

In light of the frequency and severity of NFT theft, SlowMist Technologies has published two targeted tracking analyses to combat NFT phishing groups. On December 24, 2022, SlowMist Technologies released the “[Investigation of North Korean APT’s Large-Scale Phishing Attack on NFT Users](https://slowmist.medium.com/slowmist-our-in-depth-investigation-of-north-korean-apts-large-scale-phishing-attack-on-nft-users-362117600519)” worldwide. An APT group carried out widespread phishing attacks against NFT users within the encrypted ecosystem. The involved addresses have been flagged as high-risk phishing addresses by MistTrack, and the APT group managed to obtain 1,055 NFTs, resulting in a profit of almost 300 ETH.

According to MistTrack-related data statistics, SlowMist Technologies released “ [Analysis of Monkey Drainer NFT Phishing Group](https://slowmist.medium.com/slowmist-analysis-of-monkey-drainer-nft-phishing-group-e4e269634854)” on February 10, 2023. The Monkey Drainer group made roughly $12.97 million through phishing, obtaining 7,059 NFTs and 4,695.91 ETH, which equated to $7.61 million and constituted 58.66% of the stolen funds. The profit from ERC20 tokens amounted to around $5.362 million, representing 41.34% of the stolen funds. The primary ERC20 token types included USDC, USDT, LINK, ENS, and stETH.

As of January 2023, hundreds of high-profile security breaches have resulted in the loss of almost $200 million worth of NFTs, according to data from SlowMist’s blockchain hacking event database (hacked.slowmist.io) and Elliptic.

SlowMist’s findings indicate that in 2022, NFT theft incidents were primarily centered around the Ethereum network and social media channels. Attackers employed a variety of techniques, including counterfeit domains, fake domain names that resembled project parties, malicious trojans, and phishing attacks through false links distributed via Discord intrusions. The average loss per phishing attack was around $100,000. It appears that hackers are the only ones benefiting, irrespective of whether the market is bullish or bearish.

Given the hostile environment of phishing and fraud, in which both regular users and project creators are frequent targets, what measures can NFT users take to protect themselves? Are users merely regarded as defenseless prey in these scenarios?

Absolutely not! We have been promoting a blend of human prevention and technical prevention measures, encompassing personal security awareness defense and technical defense tactics. Personal security awareness defense pertains to an individual’s security consciousness. We suggest that cryptocurrency users take a cue from the Blockchain Dark Forest Self-Defense Manual.

Given that humans are intricate, advanced beings, we will not delve into personal security awareness defense in-depth today. Instead, we strongly encourage everyone to carefully peruse the Blockchain Dark Forest Self-Defense Manual.

What do technical defense measures entail? In essence, it involves utilizing security measures such as software, hardware, and browser plug-ins to safeguard assets. Within the NFT user community, the most frequently used operational technique is browser interaction, accounting for 90%, and it is also the most susceptible environment. Currently, numerous anti-phishing browser plug-ins are available on the market. In the following section, we will scrutinize and contrast these plug-ins, with the hope of offering some security guidance to NFT users.

## Security Plugin Comparison

***Disclaimer: The ensuing evaluation of various browser security plug-ins is solely grounded on fundamental information, live phishing detection for NFTs, and basic operational comparisons. SlowMist is simply an impartial third party and does not accept any liability or legal responsibility.***
